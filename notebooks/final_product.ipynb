    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "My final infographic depicts an analysis of features that affect NBA underdog wins and looks into betting outcomes based off those factors. The data is raw NBA data pulled from Kaggle. I cleaned it to only look into data from the 2007-2018 NBA season. \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by describing terms like \"upset\" and \"underdog\" to give context to the infographic. I then move onto show highlight some key features that have an influence on underdog wins. I start by analyzing Home Status, whether a team plays a home game or an away game, and teams' win percentages as an underdog. The bar plot clearly displays a large gap between Home and Away games. This gap is nearly 40% showing that underdogs who play at Home win games at a historical rate `40%` higher than underdogs playing Away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I move onto show the relationship between a given win percentage bin and underdog win percentage. These win percentage bins is a running percentage through each season. It calculates their current win percentage and compares it to every other team's current win percentage. Then, the team will be placed into a bin based on what quartile their win percentage falls into.  The bar plot shows a trend as you increase in win percentage, underdog win percentage also increases. This trend is consistent across all win percentage bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the features, I show both Home Status and Win Percentage Bins combined on a heatmap to see how they interact with each other for the select scenario. As expected, underdogs who play at Home and have a High win percentage have the highest underdog win percentage at `79.0%`. On the contrary, underdogs who play Away and have a Low win percentage have the lowest underdog win percentage at `20.3%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I get into the betting analysis. Taking the various betting strategies, I simulate what would happen if you were to have flat bet `$1` on the underdog in every single game that fits your betting strategy criteria. The `\"All\"` strategy will bet `$1` on the underdog in every game available. Through the `\"All\"` strategy, you would have profited `$7,613.35` after betting on 8,404 games from 2007-2018. You would have wagered `$8,404` and you would be paid back `$16,017.3` in total. Similarly, the `\"Away\"` strategy will bet on the underdog in every game where the underdog team is also the team playing Away. Through the `\"Away\"` strategy, you would have lost `$152.48` after betting on 4,255 games from 2007-2018. You would have wagered `$4,255` and you would be paid back `$4,102.52` in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also mention uncertainty about trying to implement these betting strategies in real life. Due to the fact that this data is from 2007-2018, it is not fully reflective of how sportbooks operate today. As the sportbook market becomes more competitive, and their own forecasting models become more accurate, the odds may have changed drastically over the years. Therefore, it is important to note that while these betting strategies may have been profitable in the past, they may not be as effective today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this infographic provides a detailed analysis of a few features that might impact upsets in the NBA. Maybe moving forward, we can revisit this analysis with the most recent data and see how the trends have changed."
